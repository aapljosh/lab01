#Introduction
 - Provide a brief overview of the problem.
The goal of this code repository is to implement a VGA driver for the Spartan 6 FPGA.

#Implementation
- Provide block-diagram of your solution and briefly describe how you implemented each the modules. Include your state-transition diagram. Commented VHDL code should be included.

#Test/Debug
- Briefly describe the methods used to verify system functionality. List the major problems you encountered and how you fixed them. This should cover all the problems you encountered in the lab and how you fixed them. It is highly encouraged that you present this section in bullet-format. At a minimum, break each problem and solution into separate
paragraphs.

Conclusion
- Explain what your learned from this lab and what changes you would recommend in future years to this lab or the lectures leading up to this lab.
